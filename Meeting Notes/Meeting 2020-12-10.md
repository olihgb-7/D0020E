# Meeting 2020-12-10

**Date:** 2020-12-10  15:00  
**Participants:** Axel, Oliver, Emma, Magnus and Jan  
**Responsible for the meeting:** Axel and Emma  


## Done since last meeting: 

We were tasked with:  
* Figuring out what went wrong from the last projects
* Think about how to implement the parsing  

## Discussion during the meeting:

We had a meeting with Tommy, we explain to Jan what went wrong for Tommy in the projects  
Tommy told us that Tommy and Jesper had different interpritations of the SysML 2.0 documentation  
Our take away of the meeting with Tommy was that we have to have a solid plan before starting development and we need a solid understanding of how SysML 2.0 works  
Tommy got stuck on the graphical re-implementation since Tommy had to redefine the syntax implementation of SysML 2.0  
Tommy mentioned problems with recursion of the graphical representation  
We asked Tommy about the previous implementation and he thought that most stuff should be redone  
Tommy thought that the parser might be implemented from already available open-source parsers created  
The library used for graphical representation might need to be replaced  
We discuss our idea to generalize parts that we are able to for us to be able to extend the code in the future  
Jan starts a discussion about IDEs and explains the difficulty to get a good overview of a project with many classes  
Jan is asking for the browser viewer tool because other tools might not be especially user friendly in some cases  
Jan wants an easy to use tool that takes actuall textual input and can display diagrams in a good way  
One goal is to have an easy tool to actually display how a system works for people that might not understand actual system implementations  
Instance interpritation of diagrams seems to not have been done and is an idea that Jan is interested in (for example to extend a block called Student where we might have intstances of Oliver, Axel, Magnus, Emma)  
We explain our thought about graphical displaying blocks by perhaps dragging them   
Some of us should look at the parsing, we discuss the idea to research pre-existing parsers  
Some of us should look at the graphical part, we discuss the idea to research preexisting graphical interfaces  
Jan explains the importance of an easy to grasp representation of a system so one can actually understand the system in question  
A focus right now is how we are supposed to parse the different objects for SysML and how we should handle the different objects in memory and link them to eachother
Research the SysML documentatition  

## For the next meeting:

* Research the SysML Documentation (specifically public Google Drive release sent by email)
* Explore parsing option and research parsing
* Explore graphical representation 

**Date for next meeting:** 2020-01-15 14:00
